# ```Intrastellar``` (A [Cascade](https://cascade.hackclub.com) project)

## Overview ‚ú®
Welcome to the limited space ‚Äî Intrastellar: Where only the orbits are infinite. This is a minimal version of an orbiting celestial body's (say, a planet's) animation around a larger celestial body (a black hole, perhaps).

## Inside Intrastellar üìÉ
> Intrastellar uses HTML to create the bodies (div) of the black hole and orbiting planet. CSS transitions the planet's movements around the stationary black hole, which has a slight white halo to depict Hawking Radiation around it. The planet slows down towards the edge, as it gets close to the black hole's event horizon, where gravity is even higher than before, slowing things from the viewer's perspective as according to Einstein's theory of relativity suggests ‚Äî The greater the gravity, the slower the time.

## The fun part ‚Äî Animating! üòã
> Animating was the best part, seeing things just work like intended ‚Äî where the animation would ease in when near the edge and ease out at the center, gaining traction. Designing for a minimal design, with subtle colors was a satisfactory experience.

## The rough part ‚Äî Also animating¬° üéä
> It took a LOT of tweaking to figure out the perfect animation rate, the perfect distance and location, the perfect transitions and the perfect design. It was a pain to tweak every little thing for 5 times just to make it 'just right'.
